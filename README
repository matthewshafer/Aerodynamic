Aerodynamic
===========

I needed a simple logging tool for a project I am working on so I decided to spend some time and put this together.
I learned a bunch of new stuff with php by working on this which is why I decided to put it together.

What It Can Do
--------------

You are able to use closures to make adding your own logging functionally pretty easy.
It also supports multiple handlers so you can have DEBUG logging go to a different place than WARNING's.
You can also have multiple handlers for each logging type, EX. you can have WARNING's go to a database, if that fails then to a file.

Notes
-----

The code is pretty messy and there is not really any documentation.
I'll add the documentation over time (its not like there is a lot to add).
Also I'll clean up the code and add new stuff as I need.
